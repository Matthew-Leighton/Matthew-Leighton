### Hi there, I'm Matt! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student in the <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/physics/sivakgroup.html">Sivak Group</a> at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada. My research is focused on understanding the physics of the microscopic molecular machinery constantly in motion within the cells of every living thing on earth. You can check out my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=j-Yk0HYAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>, or visit my <a href="https://matthewleighton.com">personal website</a> to learn more.
