### Hi there, I'm Matt! ðŸ‘‹
 
Iâ€™m an independent postdoctoral fellow at Yale University researching biological physics: basically, I focus on using quantitative tools from physics and mathematics to try to understand complex problems in biology. Iâ€™m especially interested in nonequilibrium settings where stochastic fluctuations are important, like the interior of the cell, but more broadly interested in any and all settings where physics meets biology. You can check out my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=j-Yk0HYAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>, or visit my <a href="https://matthewleighton.com">personal website</a> to learn more.
